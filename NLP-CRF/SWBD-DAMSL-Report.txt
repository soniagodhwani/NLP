1. Describe how you evaluated your baseline and advanced features:

I wrote a code for random sampling and divided the data as 75% training data and 25% test data.
I sampled the data multiple times and calculated the range of accuracy for both baseline tagger and advanced tagger.


2. Accuracy of baseline features during your evaluation:

Accuracy of baseline features was around 0.73 which is 72.75% (Â± 0.4%) dpending on the sample.
The exact accuracy of one of the samples is 0.7306434696773397


3. Describe your advanced feature set:

The advanced feature set includes:
    1. All the tokens
    2. All the POS tags
    3. Speaker change
    4. First Utterance
    5. Biagrams for each tokens <Previous token, current token>
    6. Bigrams for each POS <Previous POS, current token>
    7. Feature for wh questions like - "who", "what", "when", "where" etc.
    7. Feature for laughter and other noise in conversation
    8. Feature for question - ends with "?"


4. If you tried and rejected alternate advanced feature sets, please describe them:

I tried triagrams of tokens and parts of speech as token but the acuracy reduced maybe it was because of over fitting.
I also tried using last word of the sentence and last POS as feature but the accurancy was reduced.
I also used a feature of showing presence of words like ["yes","yeah","okay","sure"...] to show acknowledegement but it did not help.

5. Accuracy of advanced features was:

The accuracy using the above advanced features was around 0.745 which is 74.5%
